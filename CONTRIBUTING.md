## Version
The information  in this repo should be based on the latest version of ConnectionStrings.com that is found in the WayBack MAchine. As of this time (July 31, 2021), the latest snapshot that works was captured: July 20, 2021 14:16:26. The direct URL can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20210720141626/https://www.connectionstrings.com/)

For the time being, each section will be a file in the /docs folder. Standalone samples go into the samples folder.

The list below show what needs to be ported over. If you wish to help, either by porting over a section, conributing a codesample, or cleaning up existing documentation, clone this repository, create a branch, then submit a PR with your edits. 

Items checked off are in progress, and ones marked through are completed and are in maintenance mode.

## Template
See [TEMPLATE.md](/docs/TEMPLATE.md) for instructions on formatting.

## Code Samples
For adding larger code samples of using connection strings, put the example in the [/samples folder](/samples). Code should be organized by DB then by technology. 

Examples:
* .NET Connection to Access - /samples/access/net-connector 
* .NET Connection to SQL Server - /samples/sql-server/net-connector
* ODBC driver with MySQL - /samples/mysql/odbc
