# Connection Strings

## Introduction
On July 31, 2021 a reddit post reported ConnectionStrings.com as being unavailable. In the discusion that followed, a user suggested it be moved to a github repo. Here we are. This is an attempt at replicating the information that was found previously on ConnectionStrings.com. A copy of the website was found in the archives (WayBack Machine) dated July 20, 2021 and timestamped at 14:16:26. It is this archived version that is being used as the initial base for this repo.

## Goal
The goal of this repo is to preserve the information previously available at the now apparently defuct ConnectionStrings.com website and make it available to the general public. It's free and open. It's being provided as-is, with no warranties or guaranties, expressed or implied. 

A two phase approach will be undertaken. The first will be to simply get the information ported over as quickly as possible in a manner very similar  to the original site. The second phase, will be to refactor and rearrange the site and information to make it more managable, sustainable, allow for larger code samples and utilities to be included and/or linked to.

## Contributions
There is a lot of information here. A LOT. More than one person alone can possibly tackle alone. Also, as time moves on, technologies change, updates will be needed. If you are interested in helping, either in porting over a new section, or in contributin to an existing section, see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
