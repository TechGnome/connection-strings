# Samples

Here you can find various code samples on using connection strings. The examples here are larger examples than what can be found within the documentation and can sometimes provide context for use.

Code should be organized by DB then by technology. 

Examples:
* .NET Connection to Access - /samples/access/net-connector 
* .NET Connection to SQL Server - /samples/sql-server/net-connector
* ODBC driver with MySQL - /samples/mysql/odbc
